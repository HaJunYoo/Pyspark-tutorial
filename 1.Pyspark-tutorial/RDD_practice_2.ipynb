I commuted an hour each way, without complaint. I worked 50 hours every week at a minimum. And when I got home, I let them page me at 2 AM if something needed my attention – which happened pretty often.',\n",
              " 'Over the years, I was rewarded with more responsibility, and more money – although it never seemed to be quite enough. I was considered a role-model software development manager, and I felt successful. ',\n",
              " \"At home however, my marriage was under stress, my kids hardly knew me, and I was on prescription sleep aids in order to combat the extreme stress I was under. My family wasn't happy living in the part of the country we lived in, and they weren't happy with me. But, all that felt secondary to my duty to my employer, and my duty as a provider for my family. I was doing what I thought I had to do.\",\n",

              " \"Today, I run my own software company out of my home. I have no employees to worry about, and a revenue stream that matches anything I ever made as a successful senior manager at a big tech company. I now live someplace with a lower cost of living, I don't eat out as much, and I have no commuting costs to deal with–  so I get to keep much more of that money.  My entire family is happy, and we're closer than we've ever been.\",\n",
              " \"I don't worry about money anymore. I don't worry about my career growth, or about saying the wrong thing to some executive. I have no commute and no meetings. I don't have to be in the office at 9 AM, nor have any artificial requirement to work a set number of hours each day, or each week. I don't write or receive performance reviews. I never have to fire anyone. Nobody can fire me, and nobody can lay me off.\",\n",
              " \"I don't take sleep aids any longer, because my stress level is basically zero. I'm 43 years old, and I'm pretty sure this is what retirement is supposed to feel like –  except I'm not too old to enjoy it, and I'm not broke.\",\n",
              " \"I'm not telling you this to gloat. I'm telling you this because maybe you're like I was three years ago. Maybe some part of you knows that your only reward for your hard work is going to be a heart attack in a few years, but you feel trapped by your salary and your responsibilities. You've accepted society's expectations of focusing entirely on your work until you're 65 or so, at which point you hope you'll have enough money saved to actually retire, and enough health left to enjoy it.\",\n",

              " \"If you've spent your entire professional life working for someone else, self-employment is a very scary proposition. The life you have is familiar and comfortable, and the easiest thing is to just continue along your current career path. Discarding that career and striking out on your own is a bold thing to do. Your psyche is going to rebel against a change of this magnitude, and find ways to justify not trying it.\",\n",
              " \"It's therefore not surprising that many self-employed individuals were forced into their situation. The ones that become successful on their own talk a lot about the personal freedom they enjoy as a result, but seeking personal freedom is not what motivated them to achieve it. According to the 2012 Freelance Industry Report, 29% of freelancers fell into their self-employment by necessity, after being laid off or downsized.\",\n",
              " \"It's better to transition into self-employment on your own terms. If you start planning and set up your new business before you quit your day job, you can ensure you have income flowing from the first day you start working for yourself. This book will arm you with the details you need to make that happen, but first you need to decide if this is an effort worth taking.\",\n",
              " \"Before we talk about how to become self-employed, I want you to understand the forces working against you. I want you to come to terms with them, and I want you to understand the reasons why it is worth the effort to overcome them. That's what the first part of this book is about: understanding the barriers to self-employment, both real and imagined, and understanding why self-employment is still a goal worth pursuing. When we're done, we'll do a self-assessment to see if you're really in a position to take the leap into self-employment.\",\n",
              " 'FEAR OF FAILURE',\n",
              " 'Your paycheck puts food on the table and a roof over your head pretty reliably. The idea of giving that up quickly brings up images of your family starving and your house getting foreclosed. This is a real risk, but with proper planning and educated decision making, it’s a risk you can minimize.',\n",

              " \"But just how risky is entrepreneurship? According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the US Small Business Administration (SBA), 50% of all new businesses survive at least five years. A third of new businesses survive ten years or more. Now, think about how long you expect your current job to last. Would you say there's more than a 50% chance your employer will still be around five years from now, and you'll still be working for that same company? The Bureau of Labor Statistics has that answer as well. The average job tenure in the US in 2012 was only 4.6 years. \",\n",
              " 'Does starting your own business seem that risky now?',\n",
              " 'Here\\'s another statistic – the 2012 Freelance Industry Report shows that only 22% of freelancers feel less financially secure than when they were an employee. 28% \"strongly agree\" they are better off financially working for themselves, and 29% \"moderately agree.\" Freelancers don\\'t represent all of the self-employed, but it\\'s always an option for you.',\n",

They range from housekeepers, to construction workers, to web developers, to doctors. You don't need a fancy education and lots of professional connections to make this work – but if you have them, think of the advantage you'll have over the millions who managed to make it work without them. You don't need a full time employer to earn a living.\",\n",

Well, being raised your entire life to believe that is a worthy goal has a lot to do with it. We'll talk about external barriers to self-employment later, but the biggest barrier is probably internal – you believe self-employment is just not what you're supposed to do!\",\n",
              " 'Indoctrination is a strong word, usually reserved for religious cults and brainwashing. But, it just means being taught a set of beliefs without questioning them. Just how much do you question the idea that you must have a job in order to be a responsible member of society? One common means of indoctrination is to instill ideas into youth before they are old enough to question them, and have the ideas come from people in authority. That’s precisely what happened as you grew up, pushed along a track into a corporate job.',\n",
              " 'When you were in school, you were probably told by your parents and teachers to get good grades so you could get into college. In college, you were told to work hard so you would get a job after you graduated. And if you were lucky enough to get that job, you were absorbed into training and a culture that promotes loyalty to your employer. It’s the end result of a lifestyle choice that was indoctrinated into you at an early age.',\n",

You've been so busy following this path, that you haven't had time to even consider the alternatives. Meanwhile, you've probably picked up some new responsibilities like children, a mortgage, or student loan debt – and so the idea of giving up a steady paycheck seems terrifying, even if it's barely enough to meet your financial demands.\",\n",
              " \"If you've got bills to pay and mouths to feed, having a job is just what you do. You probably don't look forward to going to work in the morning – hardly anyone does. But you try to make the best of it, and fulfill the responsibilities life has thrust upon you – year after year. You hear about people starting their own businesses, but you think it's just way too risky for someone who has responsibilities beyond buying their next foam cup of Ramen noodles. You’ve developed what is known as “learned helplessness” – you aren’t happy with your stressful career, but you believe it is the best option available to you.\",\n",
              " \"You may think you're trapped in your career, but you're not. As with breaking any indoctrination, the first step is to understand how you got there, and develop the desire to see alternate paths. Striking out on your own and becoming self-employed is one such path that can improve your lifestyle, when done responsibly.\",\n",
              " 'THE CARROT ON A STICK',\n",
              " \"You've worked hard to get where you are in your career.  You probably believe you're just one more promotion away from a bigger paycheck that will change your lifestyle. Or all those shares of stock you've been awarded in your company are really going to pay off big one day. Why would you quit, and throw all of that away?\",\n",
              " 'Question the rewards your career is promising you, and compare them to the rewards you could achieve on your own.',\n",
              " \"If you’re working hard toward your next promotion, there are several questions you should ask yourself. Do you trust your current manager to give you that promotion, and to give you a pay increase commensurate with the increased responsibilities and stress that come with it? Do you really believe you'll win out from all of the other people struggling to get that same promotion? Are you that sure you're better than all of your other co-workers, and have a better relationship with your management than they do? The corporate career world is a zero-sum game in the end, no matter how you spin it.\",\n",
              " \"If you’re banking on equity that you have vesting in your employer’s company, ask yourself these questions: Do you trust the stock market with your net worth? Do you believe your hard work impacts your employer's bottom line to the degree that you materially affect its stock price, and the value of any equity you have in the company? Do you really believe that investment bankers will behave rationally, and reward good long-term behavior from your company? Are you working for a startup, and working almost exclusively for a tiny slice of the proceeds if your employer turns out to be a one-in-a-hundred acquisition success?\",\n",
              " 'If you’ve answered those questions honestly, you’ll see that the rewards you’re working toward are actually a pretty big gamble. You may be staying in your career out of risk-aversion, but in reality your career is a pretty risky thing, without high potential rewards.',\n",
              " \"As hard as you've worked for your employer, your employer has also worked to find ways to keep you motivated while spending as little cash as possible in the process. What do you consider a good annual raise? 3%? What sort of pay increase do you expect with a promotion? 10%? Are those stock awards really worth anything, or do they have such a long vesting schedule that they only serve to keep you around? If you’ve ever wondered if you’re just chasing the proverbial carrot on a stick, there’s a good chance you are.\",\n",
              " 'If you don’t get that promotion or that big raise, you’ll be told it’s because you didn’t work hard enough, or weren’t smart enough, compared to your peers. You might start doubting your own abilities and either work harder or accept less for your work as a result – which is precisely in your employer’s best interests, but not yours. All that time, however, you may have thrived working for yourself. I’m a case in point – my own corporate career hit a dead end when I had difficulty getting promoted to a Director-level job, but today my company earns more than a Director would. By focusing my efforts on building my own company instead of the self-promotion and lobbying required to achieve corporate career growth, I ended up both earning more and creating more.',\n",
              " \"Let’s quantify that carrot of yours. Let’s say 10% annual growth in your income sounds like a good year to you. If you're running your own small company and it only grows 10% in a year, you should be asking yourself what you're doing wrong. The rewards your employer offers you are intentionally limited – in part to minimize their expense, and in part to prevent pay inequities.\",\n",
              " \"When you work for yourself, there is no upper bound to how much more money you can earn every year. And, it's entirely under your control – you are not dependent on a manager to decide you are worthy of that reward. The market rewards you based on the quality of your products and the demand for them, end of story.\",\n",
              " \"Let me state that again, as it's a very important point – there is no upper bound to what you can make when you are self-employed. There's also no lower bound (other than zero), but with careful planning you can mitigate that risk and choose the lower bound you're willing to accept.\",\n",
              " \"Face it – you’re not going to get rich working for someone else, unless you have the connections to get into the C-suite. You might think that's attainable, but the odds are very much against you. You have much better odds of attaining significant wealth working for yourself. I’m not promising to make you a millionaire – but even a much smaller number can ensure you no longer worry about money. More importantly, the freedom that comes with self-employment means you’ll have time to enjoy the experiences that money can buy. \",\n",

              " \"If you're successful in your career, you probably feel pretty good about that. Everyone wants to be liked and respected, and a corporate job can give you that. You've probably formed some close personal bonds to some of your co-workers – working alongside others in stressful situations has that effect. It can be a hard thing to give up.\",\n",
              " \"When you start your own company – guess what, you're now a CEO. And a president. And whatever else you want to call yourself. Your friends won't think less of you; they'll probably respect you even more for having the guts to do it.\",\n",

It's been three years since I quit my job and moved 3,000 miles away – but I don't think I've lost a single friend in the process. Successful self-employment will also require you to meet new, like-minded people – and if that's not enough, there are probably multiple Meetup groups you can join filled with local entrepreneurs, or people who share your other interests. Work out of a coffee shop or shared co-working space if you really need people around you all the time; the cost is minimal.\",\n",

Once you have created a product to sell, you may sell as much of it as you can to create an ongoing stream of revenue. This is called passive income, and it’s a beautiful thing.

Many will rely on freelance work during this initial period, but freelance work does not realize the full potential of freedom and lifestyle self-employment can offer.  As a freelancer, time really is money. Your growth potential is limited by the number of billable hours you can work in a week. You're still working for other people – your clients – and developing things according to their specifications. They might even demand that you work on-site. In many cases, you're just working as a contractor so your clients can avoid the expenses of providing benefits to you and employing you over a longer period of time. As mentioned earlier, 90% of freelancers do believe their lifestyle is better than traditional employment – but you can do even better. You should have another revenue stream gestating that can take its place over time. As a freelancer, your clients have no expectation that you only work on their tasks.

Their ultimate goal is usually to sell the company to a larger company, and get rich in the process through whatever personal stake they may still have in it. At that point, the investors get rich as well.',\n",

Their objective is not to grow into a company that employs thousands of people, or to get acquired by Google for billions of dollars. Their goal is to simply do what they love to do on their own terms, and earn enough money doing it such that they can enjoy life and some freedom.

              " \"When planning for a new lifestyle business, we want to maximize all of the benefits of self-employment we discussed earlier. Your business should be designed to do so from the start. Let's review those benefits, and how your business can realize them to their fullest.\",\n",
              " \"Unlimited growth potential. Your business should create products that can create an ongoing revenue stream with minimal further investment of your own time. Your time is limited, and a business that can only grow with the time you put into it cannot scale. A freelancer's business cannot scale beyond that freelancer's available time; but building a marketplace for freelancers can. The ideal situation is to create digital products with some time up front, which can then sell themselves indefinitely through online purchasing and distribution, completely automatically. Even your marketing can be largely automated through targeted online ads and building a website optimized for conversions. Physical products can work the same way, if you can outsource the production and distribution of your product at a reasonable cost.\",\n",
              " \"Investing in yourself, not someone else. You want to avoid the need to take on investors or debt in order to start your business. Instead, create a business you may bootstrap using the time and money you have available while you're still employed. Investors generally are not interested in funding a lifestyle business anyhow – they want a slice of a big payoff at the end, and have no interest in your lifestyle. Bank loans for small businesses are difficult to come by these days (unless they are backed by collateral), which really only leaves bootstrapping and crowd-funding as options anyhow. This is all for the best, however. Self-funding your new business means that you have no investors who can demand that you do things their way, and it means that the profits from your business are entirely your own going forward. The good news is that many modern businesses do not require a large cash outlay up front – often, all you need is a website, a computer, and an Internet connection – plus that financial safety net we talked about earlier.\",\n",
              " \"No dependencies. Think about what or who your new business will depend upon for success. Of course, you'll depend on your customer base – but are there other dependencies outside of your control that could get in your way? A good example is a company that relies on government contracts. Will you get paid the next time Congress forces the government into a temporary shutdown? Do you know all of the arcane paperwork and regulations that are required in order to actually get paid by the government in a timely manner? Do you know how long it takes for a government contract to get awarded before you receive a penny from it? There's a lot in this example that's outside of your control, which can absolutely kill a new business that's starting out. A more common problem is relying on suppliers for your business that may not be able to deliver what you need on time or to your specifications. If you’re selling stuff that other people provide, make sure you have a pool of potential suppliers to use in case one doesn’t work out.\",\n",
              " \"Freedom to work where you want. If your business requires physical interaction with people, you're thinking too small. By tying yourself to people in a specific location, you are both giving up some freedom and limiting your growth potential. Instead of planning to open up a beauty salon for local individuals, consider selling beauty products on the Internet to people around the entire world all at once. Then, if your business becomes successful, you have the freedom to move to Tahiti without losing a single customer in the process.\",\n",
              " \"If freedom from commuting and freedom of location are important to you, it's also important to plan a business that does not involve hiring employees that require your physical oversight. As your business grows, can you start hiring freelancers and independent contractors remotely to help out? Can you outsource much of what you do? If so, that's a business that can scale beyond your own time and one that offers the most freedom. If your business is such that you must hire people that require face-to-face management in order to grow, then you're going to find yourself tied to an office where you must be physically present at least as long as your employees are. You're giving up a lot of the benefits of self-employment in that case.\",\n",
              " 'No commute. One of those benefits is not dealing with a daily commute, and reclaiming those hours of your life. If your customers are all concentrated inside the city, you live in the suburbs, and your product is such that you need a physical presence with your customers – you’re doing it wrong on many counts. First of all, the fact that you require a physical presence with your customers violates the first tenet of \"unlimited growth potential\" – you can only make as many sales as you have time to see your customers physically. Maybe you\\'re a contractor who must be at a client\\'s office you must commute to – but again, such a business cannot scale beyond the time you have available. ',\n",
              " 'Freedom to work when you want. Yet again, this comes back to the theme of not creating a business that requires face-to-face contact with your clients. If your business is one such that you supply products, not services, to customers – then as long as you respond to their messages within a day, they will generally be happy. You can choose to batch up all of those messages and handle them in the same hour every day, or respond to them throughout whatever window of time you decide to dedicate to your work. But when that is remains up to you, and you have the flexibility to change it as needed.',\n",

If you have someone working for you from 9-5 that isn't experienced enough to work independently, then you too need to be available from 9-5. If you aren't, you'll have someone wasting their time figuring stuff out on their own, or doing things incorrectly, and still sticking you with the bill for that time.\",\n",
              " \"Freedom to work how you want. A big part of why you're considering self-employment is because you want to be your own boss. But certain kinds of businesses afford more creative freedom than others. As mentioned earlier, freelancing is a good way to keep paying the bills during the early stage of your business, but as a freelancer you're just trading your old boss for a bunch of new ones: your clients, who all want things produced to their exact specifications. Working for a client as a freelancer isn't all that much different than being an employee, except you probably don't have to go to as many meetings, and you're hopefully paid more per hour to compensate for your lack of benefits.\",\n",

As soon as someone other than you has a financial stake in your endeavor, they will probably want some ability to call the shots. It may be well-meaning advice, but if their money is on the line, you can bet they expect you to act upon it. Free advice, without strings, is easy to get – you don't need investors for that. This is why I advise starting your business before you quit your day job, if at all possible. Choosing a business that does not require a large cash outlay up front can make that possible. \",\n",
              " \"My advice so far is admittedly self-centered. I'm telling you to avoid hiring people, avoid involving investors, and avoid creating a business that depends on strong ties to your local community.  This might go against everything you've been taught all your life about being a good member of the community. If you want to remain tied to that community indefinitely and have your schedule revolve around them, that's fine. Perhaps creating local jobs and new, deeper relationships with members of your community is in fact what motivates you. I won't stop you. Just understand what you're giving up – if your business takes off, you're still going to be tied to a local office working 9-5. You won't have the option to up and move someplace warm and work whenever you want to, without the need to sell your company or to give up its revenue stream. Working out of a beachside café in Hawaii a few years from now will be how your story ends, only if you craft your business with that end in mind. To maximize your personal freedom, your business must be portable, global, and avoid full-time employees that cannot be easily replaced or managed remotely.\",\n",

The trick is finding a niche that isn't currently well-served. What weird things are you passionate about? Is it just weird enough that there aren't many people producing merchandise for that interest, but not so weird that there is no real market for it? The other trick is selling something unique – if you're selling some commodity like electronics that any other retailer can offer, probably at a lower price, people will have no reason to buy from you.  Do your research – search for existing offerings and understand your competition before diving in. Also research the size of the market; get a Google AdWords account, and that will let you look up the popularity of specific search terms, which is a decent metric of what interests are more popular than others. Through the magic of drop-shipping, you may be even be able to separate yourself from the work of producing and distributing your product. This is also something you can try out on the weekends, before quitting your day job.\",\n",
              " \"Build an Online Marketplace for Services. Although I generally recommend selling products instead of services, in this case, services are the product. You're not directly responsible for the services provided; you just connect contractors and freelancers with clients for a fee. Angie's List is one extreme of this idea, but you could imagine building similar marketplaces for niche industries. Finding reliable software engineer freelancers, for example, is still a challenge. Again, this is an idea you can start up with minimal cash and time up front, and see if it grows before quitting the day job.\",\n",

I saw that there were surprisingly few books on the topic of self-employment and lifestyle businesses, and writing one isn't that much work – so why not try it? Once it's written, it can generate revenue for years. If you have an area of expertise that's in demand, but niche enough that there aren't a lot of traditional educational options on it – odds are other people want to learn about it, and might stumble across your book in the process. Now that self-publishing and digital distribution of books is actually a viable business model, a book sold for a few dollars can still reach a large number of readers and generate decent income. As with everything, it's about finding an underserved niche – I hope the world needs this book, but it probably doesn't need another vampire romance novel.\",\n",

As college tuition becomes increasingly expensive, more people are turning to online courses such as those offered through Coursera, Udemy, and General Assembly.

Two, it validates this is something you can accomplish yourself or with minimal freelance help. That makes it much easier to self-fund, it keeps your ongoing expenses low, and it frees you from the responsibilities that come with hiring people. Remember to check your employment agreement, and ensure working on this business won’t violate the terms of your employment or compete with your current employer.',\n",

In contrast, a product you must personally create by hand for each customer is limited by the amount of time you have to create it. Even worse, selling your time as a service billed hourly can never scale beyond the number of productive hours you have in a week.

For example, don't estimate the size of your market by saying X% of the 7 billion people on the planet might be interested in it – that will almost always grossly overestimate it. Instead, start with a more realistic estimate of the number of customers in your local area or in similar niches, and work your way up.

I'm offering you a more productive way to spend that time, and dedicate it to your own future instead.\",\n",

More is better, but the important thing is to maintain a steady, diligent effort sustained over time toward getting your product to market.

              " 'It’s important that what little time you have for developing your product is focused.  There is an entire methodology called \"Lean Startup\" that describes building what your customers care about, and nothing more, and it\\'s achieved almost a cult-like status among today\\'s young entrepreneurs. I’ll again recommend reading \"The Lean Startup\" by Eric Ries as a good investment; your spare time is precious, and you don\\'t want to waste it building a product that\\'s more complex than it needs to be, or does not address the needs of your customers. Some very good advice is to interview potential customers of your product to learn more about the problems they need to solve and how your product might solve them. Your product idea could change entirely based on those conversations. If you’re building your business around a subject area you’re already proficient in, you probably know some potential customers personally already. They’d probably be happy to talk over lunch or over the phone to help you get started. Just have an open-ended conversation that starts with “what problems in your business keep you awake at night?” If your product idea doesn’t help solve them, you might have the wrong product!',\n",
              " \"Don't take the mantra of Lean as meaning it's OK to release a half-assed product. It means you are releasing the product that meets your initial customers' needs – no more, and no less. Quality is still important – if you release a product that doesn't work or is esthetically distasteful, you'll never know if it failed because it lacked polish or because it was a bad idea. If your product does lack polish, you can be sure the only reward for all your hard work will be a bunch of negative comments on the Internet. The idea may have been sound, but if you only spent a few more months refining your product before launching it, the result could have been very different.\",\n",
              " \"So, it's important to know when your product is done. Stick to your product definition unless customer research motivates you to change course. When you've got something working, realize what you have is a prototype and not a product – find a few people to try it out for you and provide feedback before you release it to the world.  You have become too close to the product to know if it's good or not; you must obtain honest feedback from others, who are not afraid to provide it.\",\n",
              " \"If you’re building a digital product, then it’s straightforward how to create and refine it. If you are building some sort of digital service, cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) can provide a very low-cost means of developing an initial offering, while still having a path toward scaling the service up if it is successful.

Websites like alibaba.com can be useful for identifying overseas manufacturers with experience producing products that are similar to your own (and for double-checking that someone else isn\\'t already making it!) Searching the web for \"How to get your stuff made in China\" actually brings up several detailed, highly useful articles on the subject. There are also companies like Neomek that you can hire to create your prototype for you, and do initial low-volume manufacturing (I\\'ve never used them myself, so don\\'t take that as an endorsement).

It's actually not hard to set this up on your own, but it's easy to make the wrong choices. An LLC may offer no real protection to you, yet cost significantly more to set up than a sole proprietorship. Splitting the company 50/50 with your spouse may seem like a good idea, but it can cause big problems if you need to sell your company later. It is worth a few hundred dollars to involve a professional to determine the best corporate structure for your new business, even if it is only you.

If your business involves technology or any sort of research and development, I recommend finding one who is familiar with the R&D tax credit laws if you're in the US.

Even while you still have your day job, any money your side business earns is still self-employment income, and it is taxable.

Your accountant doesn’t have time to look at your business plan, but come prepared with your realistic estimate of your net profit in the first tax year. If you plan on hiring or contracting anyone to help out with the ongoing development of your business, be sure your accountant knows about that as well. You will have reporting requirements to the IRS about money you spend on contractors that you need to understand, and there are rules about who can be considered a contractor and who is an employee.',\n",

That includes deductions for space in your home used exclusively as a home office, business-related travel expenses (including trips in your own car,) a portion of any utility bills or house repairs for your house that contains your home office, and more. Talk to your accountant about what receipts you should be keeping, and how to keep track of your expenses going forward. I use Quickbooks Online to keep track of my bookkeeping. It's fairly easy to use, but if your accountant can help teach you how to use it properly, it's cheaper to do that now than to pay him to clean up your books at tax time later on. An accounting package such as Quickbooks is not only important for tax purposes, but also for measuring trends in your business and cash flow, issuing and tracking invoices, and other activities that are crucial to your business. You must take the time to become familiar with Quickbooks (or something like it, as long as it’s a package your accountant is also familiar with) before you spend or earn a penny on your business.\",\n",

How many people visited your website does not matter – at this stage, most of them are probably bots or people clicking on your ads by mistake anyhow. It's good to understand trends on your website through Google Analytics or similar tools, but these website metrics can be very distracting and misleading if you don't understand them deeply enough. How many people use a free version of your product also does not matter. These metrics maybe mean something in your day job at a larger company, but when it's your livelihood on the line, all that matters is the profit you make. I said profit, not revenue. If you earn $10,000 from your initial launch, but it cost $11,000 to manufacture the products you sold – you lose. (A nuance here is the concept of fixed versus variable costs – what you care about is how much money your business can generate on its own in the long run. Costs you sunk into product development are a one-time, variable expense, and so you wouldn't count those against your revenue when calculating profit for these purposes. Ongoing, fixed expenses such as the cost of producing your goods, or the cost of advertising and web hosting needed to produce those sales, would count.)\",\n",

It doesn't necessarily mean you give up – but you may need to spend more time refining your product offering in order to grow your profit to the point it needs to be. If you're a little short, that might be OK – you are only giving this business a part-time effort at this point, and it's pretty safe to say that it will be more successful once you dedicate your full-time attention to It.\",\n",

Will you post on forums and mailing lists (in a tactful way that doesn't sound sales-ey?) Will you publish to social networks, LinkedIn groups, and the like? Will you issue a press release – and if so, which editors will you send it to? Will you pay for some online targeted advertising to drive some initial traffic to your product's website?

If you are selling your product through an online storefront, how are the reviews?

Their comments are rarely constructive. The best thing you can do is ignore them, although that's very hard to do at first. You must resist the temptation to give them the attention they're seeking by reacting to their inflammatory comments. If your product does have merit, you'll often find that others come to your defense on your behalf. Just be thankful that your product launch was big enough to get noticed by Internet trolls! That in itself is an accomplishment. In the end, it's not online comments that matter; it's the people who vote with their wallets by purchasing your product. If comments are overwhelmingly negative, that will affect your sales – but if nobody's coming to your defense against the trolls, perhaps your product does in fact require refinement.

If you need to get a new auto loan or lease, or buy a new house, it\\'s going to be a lot easier to do that before you quit your day job. In my case, I bought my new house in Florida as a \"second home\" before turning in my notice, and I also purchased a new car from an Orlando dealership that would be waiting for us when we got there. Had I waited until after quitting, that may have been impossible. Working out a relocation at the same time as this career change can be tricky, but it can be done. Taking on new debt at a time like this may sound crazy, but as long as you\\'re disposing of higher levels of monthly payments at the same time (by selling your old house and car), it\\'s a win.

For a low monthly cost, I've received free consultations with web designers, accountants, lawyers, government contracting officials, and an entire course on entrepreneurship – along with an office and meeting space when I need it. It's pretty common for people to enter this program before they have quit their day job, and get some extra education on successful entrepreneurship before taking the plunge. If your locale has similar resources, I encourage you to explore them. They can even connect you with local angel investors.

Everyone's path is a little different, and what worked for someone else's business might not be relevant to yours. For example, in the early days of my business, I received a lot of advice about sales techniques – but these were from people doing business only in our local area. My global, Internet-based business did not benefit from these techniques, and ultimately it proved to just be a distraction. The people who started businesses similar to my own provided the best advice in the long run.

I've heard lots of horror stories about people handing over some ownership of their business to a board of advisors, or even worse a partner, who promptly disappears as soon as you've signed over a portion of your business to them. There should be no shortage of people willing to help you for free. If you really, really want to give up some ownership of your company for some bizarre reason, make sure any agreement is drafted by your own lawyer and is explicit about what they are expected to do in order to retain that ownership stake. Your lawyer will hopefully talk some sense into you at this point, anyhow. And always ensure you retain a majority stake in your business – it’s not uncommon for a board to fire its founder and CEO, leaving you fired from your own business.

              " 'One quick side note: the information underneath the three stars or dashes is only for the editors to see; it will not be published. That’s why I obscured my personal telephone number.  If possible, you should include the preferred way for customers to learn more about your product in the body of the press release instead. Think about the forms of communication your customers prefer; if they do talk on the phone, perhaps listing a phone number is appropriate. For my business, it’s much more efficient for everyone to use email, so that’s the form of communication my website steers people toward.',\n",
              " \"It's important to understand who you're trying to reach with your press release. In my case, my potential customers are highly technical – but the editors I'm trying to get past are not. So, most of this press release can be understood be someone with a cursory understanding of the technology being discussed –  but I made sure enough technical details were included inside the press release to appeal to the engineers I'm trying to reach.\",\n",
              " 'Sometimes you will want to create different versions of the same press release for different audiences. I have crafted press releases intended for mass media coverage that have no technical jargon at all, press releases targeted to video game developers, and press releases targeted to people developing flight or maritime training simulators all for the same announcement. Customizing the press release to fit the publications you are submitting it to can only help.',\n",
              " \"Avoid hyperbole in your press release; remember journalists are supposed to be objective, so writing about how your product is the best thing ever and how it will change the world without concrete substantiation is not OK. It's expected that you'll toot your own horn a little bit in a product announcement press release, but try and stick to the facts.\",\n",
              " \"Once you've written your press release, proofread it and double check for any errors. The next problem is distributing it.\",\n",
              " 'Your goals are twofold: get some media placement that generates interest in your company, and get some search engine optimization benefits by getting links to your website on other websites. The more people are talking about your website across the web, the more likely your website is to come up in search results when potential customers are looking for something like your product.',\n",
              " 'Using a press release submission service will probably not achieve either of those goals. Your press release will end up in a huge pile of others for a given broad category of businesses, or for a geographical region. Unless what you are doing is truly newsworthy and somehow your headline catches the attention of an editor, it will be ignored. Some websites will pick up and publish any press release that comes out, but Google knows about them. These links will not improve your search engine placements.',\n",
              " 'Instead, you need to find contact information for the handful of publications that might be genuinely interested in your press release. Your local newspaper might want to highlight a local business. Industry-specific publications are usually a safe bet, especially if your press release is accompanied by an image they can use in their publication. Contact information for their editorial staff is usually available at their website or within the publication itself. If you do include images with your press release, make sure they are at 300 DPI (dots per inch), in a non-compressed image format such as PNG, and large enough to span across a printed page at 300 DPI.',\n",
              " 'Even more valuable are industry-specific news sites. Most will have online forms for submitting news. Again, you may want to tailor your message for each specific site. If there is a specific thing this site covers, be sure to mention how your news item is related to it in the headline. Look at other news articles on the site, and make sure your style and format is similar – instead of a formal press release, an informal one or two paragraph summary with a link to the press release (hosted on your website) may be more appropriate.',\n",
              " \"The general idea is to find the websites and publications that cater to the particular niche you are marketing your product to, and craft a message that's relevant to each one.\",\n",
              " 'Generally speaking, there is no equivalent to a cover letter or introductory text that accompanies your press release. Editors don’t have time to read such things; your press release should stand on its own merit, and it includes your contact information should they have questions. I generally just email them to individual editors with the press release as the body of the message, and a subject line that starts with “PR:” followed by the headline. If you have a print-quality image or two to include with the release, just attach them.',\n",
              " 'The beauty of press releases is that they are free! It only costs your time to identify the channels you want to push your message to, and craft a message that they will be likely to pick up. Be prepared however for salespeople to try and sell you paid advertising from these same publications. Usually the pitch is \"Good news! We\\'re going to publish your press release in our next issue. Wouldn\\'t you like to accompany that coverage with an ad? I can offer you a first-time discount...\" We\\'ll cover that later under marketing; sometimes it\\'s worthwhile to do so, and although most editors would never admit it publicly, I\\'ve found that publications and websites you advertise on are much more likely to publish your press releases.',\n",
              " \"Press releases can also help to establish a relationship with the editors of the publications that cater to your niche. Once they know who you are, they might consider you to be an industry expert on whatever your company is about, which means you might get interviewed for a future article– leading to more free publicity for your company. Don't just wait for it to happen, however. If you do receive a follow-up message from an editor in response to your news submission, be sure the mention in your reply that you know a lot about some topic of general issue to their readership, and you'd be happy to provide interview responses for future articles.\",\n",
              " \"There are even websites that specialize in connecting reporters with industry experts, such as helpareporter.com, although I can't speak to their effectiveness. Far better is to have a relationship with the editors of the publications most relevant to your business. I'm often quoted alongside representatives of billion-dollar companies in the industry press as a result of my PR work, which not only keeps awareness of my company up, but makes my company seem much bigger than it really is.\",\n",

If you're using WordPress, be sure to install and properly configure a plugin such as W3 Total Cache (W3TC) to cache your pages and help your web server perform better. If your news release does direct readers to a specific web page, this is an opportunity to put landing page optimization (LPO) into use– so be sure to read that section below as well. You want to convert as many people who follow the link to your site into paying customers as possible, and there are techniques for doing so.\",\n",
              " 'Keeping an archive of your press releases on your website can’t hurt, either. Additional content is always good for search engine optimization purposes, and it helps reinforce to customers that you’re a real company with a real PR effort. You need to maintain that effort, however. If the most recent press release on your site is from two years ago, customers will instead wonder if your company is still viable!',\n",

              " \"Google offers an impressive toolset for targeted online advertising. You can decide how much or how little you're willing to spend on advertising, and Google will automatically start working to ensure the best people start seeing your ads both in search results and across the web. Go set up an account, and start familiarizing yourself with it. \",\n",
              " 'First, some terminology: \"search ads\" are the ads you see when searching for something on Google. Usually, the first few search results are actually paid placements, and  you\\'ll also see text ads on the right hand side of your search results. All of these ads came from people who bid on the terms you searched for, who believe your search might mean you\\'re interested in what they offer. You can play this game as well.',\n",
              " '\"Display ads\" are the ad images you see all over the web. Banner ads, \"skyscraper ads\" on the side, square-shaped ads– they all come in different sizes. Google offers an ad network called AdSense, and you can buy ad placements on websites that participate in it. You can target your display ads to specific websites, or let Google try to automatically find relevant websites for you.',\n",
              " \"Here are various lessons I've learned the hard way about getting the most value out of your AdWords spending:\",\n",
              " 'Understand and measure what you want people to do. AdWords will provide you with stunning amount of graphs and statistics surrounding the performance of your advertising campaigns– but there is only one number that really matters: your cost per action (CPA).  This is how much, on average, you paid to create a new customer through your ads. In order to measure CPA, you will need to find some action that users take on your website that indicates they have become a customer, and feed those actions back to Google. Usually this means they purchased something from you online. If you are using a third-party storefront to sell your products, ask them how they are integrated with Google AdWords or with Google Analytics and how to tie into your AdWords account. If customers perform this action on your own website, AdWords will tell you how to insert some extra code in your website that notifies Google when this action occurs.',\n",
              " 'CPA is usually referred to as \"cost per converted click\" within AdWords, and you may need to add a column for this metric to your views within AdWords to see it and track it.',\n",
              " 'You can set up AdWords campaigns that automatically optimize for the best CPA, but for this to work well, you need a good amount of \"action\" data. If your business relies on a small number of high-dollar sales, sales might not be the best action to measure. In this case, you may need to use some proxy for sales, such as downloading an evaluation of your product, in order to generate sufficient data for Google to work with.',\n",
              " \"If the action you want of your visitors doesn't take place online at all, you have a bit of a problem. Perhaps you are running a retail storefront, and what you're trying to do is get people to visit your physical store. First of all, consider if there's an opportunity to also sell your goods online, where you can measure the effectiveness of your advertising. If not, you can at least restrict your online advertising geographically to people who are near your physical storefront. A geographically restricted, targeted ad campaign will be inexpensive, so even if you can't measure its results directly, it's probably still worth doing.\",\n",
              " \"You need to decide how much you're willing to spend on whatever action you choose to measure. You don't want to spend $10 in exchange for a customer who only gives you $5 in profit. Even breaking even isn't enough– some of the customers that came to your website through ad campaigns may have found you anyhow through other means.  If your CPA isn't significantly less than the value of the action you are measuring, then your ad campaign is not effective and needs further tuning.\",\n",
              " \"Tread carefully with mobile ads. By default, your ads will appear on desktop PC's, tablets, and mobile devices. If your desired action requires that the user is on a PC, then you're largely throwing your money away on tablet and mobile ads. Google does give you the ability to modify the devices your ads are shown on, so use that wisely. \",\n",
              " \"Also realize that the smaller the screen, the more likely someone is to tap your ad by mistake. Google will charge you by the click, even if you're optimizing for actions– so if people are tapping your ad that had no interest in your product, you are going to be driving up your CPA for no reason.\",\n",
              " 'What\\'s even worse are ads embedded inside mobile apps. App developers often make all of their money through these ads, and sometimes design their apps to trick users into clicking on them. Google does not make it easy to disable these sorts of ads, but it can be done. You\\'ll have to search for the current technique, as it is likely to change over time. At the time of this writing, you can exclude mobile app ads by setting up a \"campaign placement exclusion\" for adsenseformobileapps.com.',\n",
              " \"Separate your search and display campaigns. It's a good practice to set up separate ad campaigns in AdWords for your ads that appear alongside search results, and for your banner ads that appear on websites that participate in Google's advertiser network. That way, Google can optimize these very different campaigns separately.\",\n",
              " \"Don't display your ads in countries that won't buy your product. Your campaign settings allow you to list specific countries your ad will appear in, as well as specific countries you don't want your campaign to appear in. To minimize the risk of click fraud– companies that just click on ads on websites automatically in order to generate revenue for those sites– don't display your ads in countries that are unlikely to want your product. I don't want to name names, but some countries are more notorious than others when it comes to click fraud. At a minimum, you'll want to ban countries that are embargoed that you can't do business with in the first place. You can get a list of embargoed countries from the US Department of State's website. Countries where the English language isn't commonly known may also be worth avoiding, if your website is in English. You may be surprised how many foreigners do know English as a second language however; some of the top countries that visit my website include Russia, China, and Germany, and they spend real money once they get there.\",\n",
              " \"Tread carefully with the display ad network. If you are targeting a narrow niche of customers, it will be difficult for Google to automatically find the best websites to show your ads on. Instead of letting Google pick what sites to display your banner ads on, choose your own list and specify them as placements in your ad groups. Using the display ad network also increases your chance of being a victim of click fraud– I've found it often drives up traffic to my website significantly, but it doesn't increase business because most of the clicks were fraudulent or done by mistake. Search ads, and display ads that target specific people instead of certain kinds of websites, are more effective.\",\n",
              " 'Use negative keywords. In your search campaigns, periodically check what people are actually searching for before they click on your ads. You can see this under the \"dimensions\" tab of your campaign in AdWords, and then selecting \"search terms\" for the view. Sort this list by cost to see what search terms you\\'re paying the most for.',\n",
              " 'You will probably find that you\\'re spending a lot of money on people searching for things completely unrelated to your business. Perhaps they clicked on your ads out of curiosity, or by mistake– but either way it cost you money. At the bottom of the keyword list is a space for \"negative keywords\"– collect these searches that you don\\'t want to pay for there, and it will prevent you from paying for them in the future.',\n",
              " 'You should check this at least weekly at first, because as soon as you ban one negative keyword, a new one will probably pop up to take its place. New trends can even emerge that affect you– for example, one of my own products is called \"SilverLining\". When the movie \"Silver Lining Playbook\" came out, I ended up paying hundreds of dollars from people searching for it.',\n",
              " 'Avoid \"broad match\" keywords. By default, the search keywords you target in your search campaign are \"broad match.\" This means that any search term that Google\\'s algorithms believe are even remotely related will be shown your ad. Sometimes it gets it right, but as reviewing your search terms will reveal, it often gets it very wrong. It is better to provide a longer list of very specific phrases that are relevant to your business, with exact or phrase matching on instead. Often, you\\'ll find this saves money in more ways than one– not only are you only showing your ads alongside relevant searches, these more specific keywords probably cost less to bid on, as there is less competition for them.',\n",
              " 'Use ad extensions on your search campaigns. Ad extensions are additional links that show up underneath your search ads. They can include links to specific pages of your website, \"call-outs\" that are short snippets of text that toot your own horn, and links that make it easy for customers to reach your physical location or to call you. They don\\'t cost anything extra, and they can result in more screen space being dedicated to your search ads. You can set these up under the \"ad extensions\" tab of your campaign view.',\n",
              " \"Try out remarketing campaigns. AdWords can give you some code to include in your website that will track customers that have visited it. You can then show display ads to them as they browse the web on other sites. A lot of people will visit your website, but not act upon it immediately. Remarketing campaigns allow you to remind them that you're around, and you have something they were interested in. This can be surprisingly effective; it's basically an automatic way to close sales without involving salespeople. Some of my best CPA's are from remarketing campaigns.\",\n",
              " 'Use \"similar visitors\". Once you have a remarketing campaign set up, you can also start showing ads to people who have similar behavior to the people who visited your website. To do this, you set up a campaign targeted to an \"audience\" that is composed to similar visitors to your website. I\\'ve found these campaigns yield CPA\\'s that are even lower than remarketing at times.',\n",
              " 'Talk to your account strategist. Once you\\'ve gotten things up and running and have started collecting some data, you\\'ll probably get a call or an email from a Google \"account strategist\" who wants to set up some time to review your account. This time can be amazingly well spent. I\\'ve found these representatives to be very knowledgeable about optimizing the results you get from your AdWords campaigns, and they often have ideas I never considered. They also take the time to try and understand your business and what you\\'re trying to accomplish before they even talk to you. Nobody knows more about optimizing AdWords campaign than Google itself, so definitely accept their help when they offer it to you.',\n",
              " 'Use landing page optimization techniques. We\\'ll talk about this more later, but the page you link an ad to (the \"landing page\") should be closely tied to the ad itself, and what the user searched for in order to see your ad. Some sites create individual pages for every ad they run, in order to ensure the page the user ends up at is as relevant as possible to their current interest and the ad they clicked on. For this to work best, you\\'ll want to split up your AdWords campaigns into separate ad groups targeted at specific customer personas, and tailor the keywords, ads, and landing pages to be unique for each ad group. AdWords is also more likely to display ads that link to pages that are highly relevant to the ad itself, and so this effort pays off in more ways than one.',\n",
              " 'Buying Banner Ads',\n",
              " 'If there are websites that are strongly related to what your business offers, you might consider purchasing ads on those sites directly. These direct ad buys are often much more expensive than what you would pay through Google AdWords or other ad networks. Sometimes, these web sites will sell ads directly, and sell any unused page views (\"impressions\") through Google\\'s AdSense network. These left-over ad impressions are known as \"remnant ads,\" and they can offer an opportunity to test the waters on a website without spending a lot of money. Check if your website is one you can target as a placement in your AdWords account, and if so, you can probably get some ads on it at a very low cost.',\n",
              " \"Those remnant ads tend to be for lower-value placements on the site however, so you can't necessarily use their performance as a gauge for how well a better-placed banner ad at the top of their site would do.\",\n",
              " 'How can you decide if a paid ad placement on a specific website is worthwhile? Well, a decent assumption is that perhaps 1% of people who see your ad on a relevant website will click on it. You can use metrics from your website to estimate what percentage of visitors to your website end up buying something, and use that information to estimate the amount of sales this ad might generate. If it’s substantially more than the expense of a given number of ad impressions, then this could be money well spent.',\n",
              " 'Oftentimes, the math won\\'t support the ad buy. The person selling you this ad will probably talk a lot about \"brand awareness\" and other intangible benefits of the ad, but you will never have any way of measuring whether it\\'s effective. Just let them know what price does make sense for you– if they aren\\'t selling through their available ad impressions, they may give you a bargain or some sort of attractive bundle deal.',\n",
              " 'If you do purchase a banner ad directly from a website owner, be sure that the URL you link the ad to contains any tracking codes required for you to measure how many visitors this ad generated, and how they behaved once they got to your website. We\\'ll talk more about Google Analytics and measuring website performance later, but if you do use Google Analytics, it offers a \"URL Builder\" tool that can construct the required URL\\'s for you. You\\'ll want to review the performance of this ad at least once a month, as you\\'ll probably find that its performance deteriorates over time as people become accustomed to your ad. When that happens, you may want to try replacing the banner ad with a fresh one in order to catch more attention.',\n",
              " 'Since you\\'re paying a lot for this ad, try to make it as relevant as possible to the readers of the site you\\'re advertising on. Make it look like it\\'s content that could even be part of the site, and not just an ad that people tune out. Some websites will offer \"advertorial\" features or “native ads” that integrate into the design of the site itself, and these are often more effective than traditional banner ads – but also more expensive.',\n",
              " \"Also, be sure to use a trained graphic designer to create your banner ads. There is a whole science to creating ads with just the right colors, contrast, and style to maximize their performance. It's money well spent. Arm your designer with some images and a very short amount of text you want included in the ad, and let them come up with ideas. You can also re-use these ads in your AdWords account, and run different variants of them at the same time to measure which ones are the most effective.\",\n",

              " 'If your business caters to a specific demographic that you can identify through gender, location, occupation, or interests– Facebook ads may be worth trying out.',\n",
              " \"Facebook users entrust Facebook with a ridiculous amount of their personal information, and you can use this to your advantage. Facebook allows you to target ads to extremely narrow demographic slices. If these slices correlate to your customers, and your customers are likely to use Facebook, then it's worth trying out. Like AdWords, you can spend as little or as much as you want– so you can test the waters with Facebook ads without incurring a large expense.\",\n",
              " \"I have personally found it challenging to achieve a cost per action with Facebook ads that outperforms a well-optimized AdWords campaign, but results will vary widely depending on the nature of your business. It's worth spending $100 as a test and just see what sort of return you get on that. Facebook also offers a robust system for measuring the performance of your ads, and so you can just decide whether to use them based on the data.\",\n",
              " 'Be sure you are looking at actual traffic generated to your website by these ads, however. Remember someone \"liking\" you on Facebook is pretty much worthless. Facebook will try and group clicks, likes, and shares together when presenting the value of your ad. Likes and shares don\\'t pay the bills– people who click on your website and buy something do.',\n",
              " 'As with display ads on Google AdWords, you need to be aware of click fraud with Facebook ads as well. There are \"click farms\" in places like the Philippines that have armies of people creating fake Facebook accounts that generate fake likes and shares for people. These can affect you, because to escape detection, they \"like\" other things they are presented (such as your ad) so it\\'s not so obvious what they are doing. The more sophisticated click farms even make it look like their clicks are originating from US cities, making them difficult to filter out. As a basic line of defense, at least set up some geographical targeting in your account to only show your ads to people in parts of the world that are likely to respond to them. There are stories of small businesses spending lots of money on Facebook ads, only to find out later that most of their response came from a click farm in Iraq. No joke. Facebook, like Google, is doing their best to eliminate fraud from their advertising programs, but it is a never-ending arms race with the fraudsters.',\n",

If the sales number you end up with exceeds the cost of the ad, it may be worth trying.

If you've followed my advice about building a business that has a global reach, local TV, radio, and news advertising probably isn't worthwhile– but for many businesses, it is. As with online advertising, the key is to find a way to target your message to the people most likely to respond to it. If there's a local TV show and you know most of its viewers are potential customers of yours, it's worth thinking about. Advertising on it won't be cheap, but it might be something you decide to save up for.\",\n",

Is there an industry trade show, conference, or convention they go to? Consider advertising in its program, or being a sponsor of it.  Are a lot of them in a specific office park? Consider a nearby billboard, or an ad on a bus stop bench. Is there a popular Meetup group for them? Consider hosting that group at your own venue, joining it, or sponsoring it. Selling your stuff at a Meetup gathering is poor form, but it's totally OK to tell people what you do while introducing yourself. People who might be interested will talk to you afterward.\",\n",

You're looking at over $10,000 plus travel expenses for even the smallest booth in most cases, so you need to be pretty confident that your presence there will generate more than $10,000 in new profits. For a small business, that's a pretty tall order. And you can't just put up a booth in the corner and expect people to come dump money on your lap– you need to do a lot of work before the trade show to publicize your booth to attendees, and arrange meetings with potential customers at the show ahead of time. You'll need to invest a lot of time in following up with people afterwards, as well. Often it's more cost-effective to just attend the show as an individual, and carry around a bunch of business cards for the connections you make while you're there. I like to walk around with a tablet running a demo of my software, so I can show interested parties my technology without a booth at all (be careful not to run afoul of any policies of the trade show when doing something like that– your smartphone may have to do if attendees aren't permitted to bring larger items onto the show floor). You may get more value focusing your time on networking at the show, instead of manning a booth. Still, consider it carefully. In some industries (arcade games come to mind), a booth at a specific trade show is basically the only way in, so I can't provide one-size-fits-all advice on the topic.\",\n",

You can always start with a paid service, and move to your own later once you know what you're doing. MailChimp even allows you to start off for free, and upgrade to a paid account only once you have a large subscriber base or need access to more advanced features. So it’s not even something you have to budget for initially.\",\n",

As with everything, keep these emails customer-focused; they should address the problems your customers are faced with, and that might not even have anything to do with your products. The main point is to remind your subscribers that you're around, and that your company is an authority in solving whatever problems they have.

Twitter is about building up your subscriber base, and staying active not only with your own announcements but in the discussions of others. Even if you have a product announcement that gets re-tweeted by some account with a huge amount of followers, you'll just see a surge of traffic that disappears within a few minutes. The goal here is to become a well-known name within the community of your potential customers– and that's better served by re-tweeting information that is useful to them, regardless of whether it comes from your company or not.

              " 'I did everything a good American employee is supposed to do. I worked hard. I devoted all of my thoughts to making this big company even more successful. I commuted an hour each way, without complaint. I worked 50 hours every week at a minimum. And when I got home, I let them page me at 2 AM if something needed my attention – which happened pretty often.',\n",
              " 'Over the years, I was rewarded with more responsibility, and more money – although it never seemed to be quite enough. I was considered a role-model software development manager, and I felt successful. ',\n",
              " \"At home however, my marriage was under stress, my kids hardly knew me, and I was on prescription sleep aids in order to combat the extreme stress I was under. My family wasn't happy living in the part of the country we lived in, and they weren't happy with me. But, all that felt secondary to my duty to my employer, and my duty as a provider for my family. I was doing what I thought I had to do.\",\n",
              " 'Three years ago, I was faced with an ultimatum from my family – it was my job, or them.',\n",
              " \"A few weeks later, I quit my job. I walked away from about a million dollars’ worth of stock grants in doing so, and I wasn't happy about it. \",\n",
              " 'But, I made the decision to try working for myself before seeking another traditional job.',\n",
              " \"Today, I run my own software company out of my home. I have no employees to worry about, and a revenue stream that matches anything I ever made as a successful senior manager at a big tech company. I now live someplace with a lower cost of living, I don't eat out as much, and I have no commuting costs to deal with–  so I get to keep much more of that money.  My entire family is happy, and we're closer than we've ever been.\",\n",
              " \"I don't worry about money anymore. I don't worry about my career growth, or about saying the wrong thing to some executive. I have no commute and no meetings. I don't have to be in the office at 9 AM, nor have any artificial requirement to work a set number of hours each day, or each week. I don't write or receive performance reviews. I never have to fire anyone. Nobody can fire me, and nobody can lay me off.\",\n",
              " \"I don't take sleep aids any longer, because my stress level is basically zero. I'm 43 years old, and I'm pretty sure this is what retirement is supposed to feel like –  except I'm not too old to enjoy it, and I'm not broke.\",\n",
              " \"I'm not telling you this to gloat. I'm telling you this because maybe you're like I was three years ago. Maybe some part of you knows that your only reward for your hard work is going to be a heart attack in a few years, but you feel trapped by your salary and your responsibilities. You've accepted society's expectations of focusing entirely on your work until you're 65 or so, at which point you hope you'll have enough money saved to actually retire, and enough health left to enjoy it.\",\n",
              " \"I'm here to tell you there is another path. Taking it isn't easy, but success means personal and financial freedom that you never knew was possible.\",\n",
              " \"This book tells you how I did it, while minimizing the risks to my family in the process. It shares what I've learned along the way. You don't have to be rich to do this, and you don't need to be a software developer. But if you have the smarts and tenacity to be self-sufficient, read on – it may just save your life, in more ways than one.\",\n",

              " \"If you've spent your entire professional life working for someone else, self-employment is a very scary proposition. The life you have is familiar and comfortable, and the easiest thing is to just continue along your current career path. Discarding that career and striking out on your own is a bold thing to do. Your psyche is going to rebel against a change of this magnitude, and find ways to justify not trying it.\",\n",
              " \"It's therefore not surprising that many self-employed individuals were forced into their situation. The ones that become successful on their own talk a lot about the personal freedom they enjoy as a result, but seeking personal freedom is not what motivated them to achieve it. According to the 2012 Freelance Industry Report, 29% of freelancers fell into their self-employment by necessity, after being laid off or downsized.\",\n",
              " \"It's better to transition into self-employment on your own terms. If you start planning and set up your new business before you quit your day job, you can ensure you have income flowing from the first day you start working for yourself. This book will arm you with the details you need to make that happen, but first you need to decide if this is an effort worth taking.\",\n",
              " \"Before we talk about how to become self-employed, I want you to understand the forces working against you. I want you to come to terms with them, and I want you to understand the reasons why it is worth the effort to overcome them. That's what the first part of this book is about: understanding the barriers to self-employment, both real and imagined, and understanding why self-employment is still a goal worth pursuing. When we're done, we'll do a self-assessment to see if you're really in a position to take the leap into self-employment.\",\n",
              " 'FEAR OF FAILURE',\n",
              " 'Your paycheck puts food on the table and a roof over your head pretty reliably. The idea of giving that up quickly brings up images of your family starving and your house getting foreclosed. This is a real risk, but with proper planning and educated decision making, it’s a risk you can minimize.',\n",
              " 'If you have responsibilities at home, you should not quit your day job until:',\n",

              " \"* You've already prototyped your business on the side and proven it is viable\",\n",
              " \"So, you're going into this with an upper bound on what you're willing to lose before calling it quits. Worst case, you learned a few things along the way.\",\n",
              " \"But just how risky is entrepreneurship? According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the US Small Business Administration (SBA), 50% of all new businesses survive at least five years. A third of new businesses survive ten years or more. Now, think about how long you expect your current job to last.

You may want to increase or decrease that estimate, depending on the employment market for people with your particular skills and experience.

Instead, go get your last 6 months of bank statements, and figure out how much you actually spend on average every month.

Your time is limited, and a business that can only grow with the time you put into it cannot scale. A freelancer's business cannot scale beyond that freelancer's available time; but building a marketplace for freelancers can. The ideal situation is to create digital products with some time up front, which can then sell themselves indefinitely through online purchasing and distribution, completely automatically. Even your marketing can be largely automated through targeted online ads and building a website optimized for conversions. Physical products can work the same way, if you can outsource the production and distribution of your product at a reasonable cost.\",\n",

Instead, create a business you may bootstrap using the time and money you have available while you're still employed. Investors generally are not interested in funding a lifestyle business anyhow – they want a slice of a big payoff at the end, and have no interest in your lifestyle. Bank loans for small businesses are difficult to come by these days (unless they are backed by collateral), which really only leaves bootstrapping and crowd-funding as options anyhow. This is all for the best, however. Self-funding your new business means that you have no investors who can demand that you do things their way, and it means that the profits from your business are entirely your own going forward. The good news is that many modern businesses do not require a large cash outlay up front – often, all you need is a website, a computer, and an Internet connection – plus that financial safety net we talked about earlier.\",\n",

Of course, you'll depend on your customer base – but are there other dependencies outside of your control that could get in your way? A good example is a company that relies on government contracts. Will you get paid the next time Congress forces the government into a temporary shutdown? Do you know all of the arcane paperwork and regulations that are required in order to actually get paid by the government in a timely manner? Do you know how long it takes for a government contract to get awarded before you receive a penny from it? There's a lot in this example that's outside of your control, which can absolutely kill a new business that's starting out. A more common problem is relying on suppliers for your business that may not be able to deliver what you need on time or to your specifications.

By tying yourself to people in a specific location, you are both giving up some freedom and limiting your growth potential.

If so, that's a business that can scale beyond your own time and one that offers the most freedom. If your business is such that you must hire people that require face-to-face management in order to grow, then you're going to find yourself tied to an office where you must be physically present at least as long as your employees are. You're giving up a lot of the benefits of self-employment in that case.\",\n",

The trick is finding a niche that isn't currently well-served. What weird things are you passionate about? Is it just weird enough that there aren't many people producing merchandise for that interest, but not so weird that there is no real market for it? The other trick is selling something unique – if you're selling some commodity like electronics that any other retailer can offer, probably at a lower price, people will have no reason to buy from you.  Do your research – search for existing offerings and understand your competition before diving in. Also research the size of the market; get a Google AdWords account, and that will let you look up the popularity of specific search terms, which is a decent metric of what interests are more popular than others. Through the magic of drop-shipping, you may be even be able to separate yourself from the work of producing and distributing your product. This is also something you can try out on the weekends, before quitting your day job.\",\n",

You're not directly responsible for the services provided; you just connect contractors and freelancers with clients for a fee.

If you have an area of expertise that's in demand, but niche enough that there aren't a lot of traditional educational options on it – odds are other people want to learn about it, and might stumble across your book in the process. Now that self-publishing and digital distribution of books is actually a viable business model, a book sold for a few dollars can still reach a large number of readers and generate decent income. As with everything, it's about finding an underserved niche – I hope the world needs this book, but it probably doesn't need another vampire romance novel.\",\n",

In contrast, a product you must personally create by hand for each customer is limited by the amount of time you have to create it. Even worse, selling your time as a service billed hourly can never scale beyond the number of productive hours you have in a week.

Websites such as Alexa, or the keyword tool in Google AdWords, can be useful for measuring trends and overall interest for a given topic. Some key advice is to always estimate a market size from the bottom-up, instead of from the top-down. For example, don't estimate the size of your market by saying X% of the 7 billion people on the planet might be interested in it – that will almost always grossly overestimate it. Instead, start with a more realistic estimate of the number of customers in your local area or in similar niches, and work your way up.

What I didn't take into consideration is that the vast majority of game developers are kids living at home, using free tools to create games that will never see the light of day. Even the ones that are doing it professionally are usually working with little to no budget. I found plenty of customers in game development – but very little revenue.

This is basically a way to protect your idea at a low cost for a period of time, while you build up enough profit to pay for a real patent application (that will run you about $10,000 by the way).

Be sure to take steps to make that as difficult to do as possible, because it will happen. It happened to me. As much as people hate digital rights management, it is something you must think about if you plan to make a living selling digital products.

If your product does lack polish, you can be sure the only reward for all your hard work will be a bunch of negative comments on the Internet.

AdWords will provide you with stunning amount of graphs and statistics surrounding the performance of your advertising campaigns– but there is only one number that really matters: your cost per action (CPA).  This is how much, on average, you paid to create a new customer through your ads. In order to measure CPA, you will need to find some action that users take on your website that indicates they have become a customer, and feed those actions back to Google. Usually this means they purchased something from you online. If you are using a third-party storefront to sell your products, ask them how they are integrated with Google AdWords or with Google Analytics and how to tie into your AdWords account. If customers perform this action on your own website, AdWords will tell you how to insert some extra code in your website that notifies Google when this action occurs.',\n",

If your business relies on a small number of high-dollar sales, sales might not be the best action to measure. In this case, you may need to use some proxy for sales, such as downloading an evaluation of your product, in order to generate sufficient data for Google to work with.',\n",

Perhaps you are running a retail storefront, and what you're trying to do is get people to visit your physical store. First of all, consider if there's an opportunity to also sell your goods online, where you can measure the effectiveness of your advertising. If not, you can at least restrict your online advertising geographically to people who are near your physical storefront. A geographically restricted, targeted ad campaign will be inexpensive, so even if you can't measure its results directly, it's probably still worth doing.\",\n",

Even breaking even isn't enough– some of the customers that came to your website through ad campaigns may have found you anyhow through other means.  If your CPA isn't significantly less than the value of the action you are measuring, then your ad campaign is not effective and needs further tuning.\",\n",
              " \"Tread carefully with mobile ads. By default, your ads will appear on desktop PC's, tablets, and mobile devices.

At the time of this writing, you can exclude mobile app ads by setting up a \"campaign placement exclusion\" for adsenseformobileapps.com.',\n",
              " \"Separate your search and display campaigns. It's a good practice to set up separate ad campaigns in AdWords for your ads that appear alongside search results, and for your banner ads that appear on websites that participate in Google's advertiser network.

I don't want to name names, but some countries are more notorious than others when it comes to click fraud. At a minimum, you'll want to ban countries that are embargoed that you can't do business with in the first place. You can get a list of embargoed countries from the US Department of State's website. Countries where the English language isn't commonly known may also be worth avoiding, if your website is in English.

Using the display ad network also increases your chance of being a victim of click fraud– I've found it often drives up traffic to my website significantly, but it doesn't increase business because most of the clicks were fraudulent or done by mistake.

It is better to provide a longer list of very specific phrases that are relevant to your business, with exact or phrase matching on instead.

To do this, you set up a campaign targeted to an \"audience\" that is composed to similar visitors to your website. I\\'ve found these campaigns yield CPA\\'s that are even lower than remarketing at times.',\n",

Once you\\'ve gotten things up and running and have started collecting some data, you\\'ll probably get a call or an email from a Google \"account strategist\" who wants to set up some time to review your account. This time can be amazingly well spent. I\\'ve found these representatives to be very knowledgeable about optimizing the results you get from your AdWords campaigns, and they often have ideas I never considered. They also take the time to try and understand your business and what you\\'re trying to accomplish before they even talk to you. Nobody knows more about optimizing AdWords campaign than Google itself, so definitely accept their help when they offer it to you.',\n",

We\\'ll talk about this more later, but the page you link an ad to (the \"landing page\") should be closely tied to the ad itself, and what the user searched for in order to see your ad. Some sites create individual pages for every ad they run, in order to ensure the page the user ends up at is as relevant as possible to their current interest and the ad they clicked on. For this to work best, you\\'ll want to split up your AdWords campaigns into separate ad groups targeted at specific customer personas, and tailor the keywords, ads, and landing pages to be unique for each ad group. AdWords is also more likely to display ads that link to pages that are highly relevant to the ad itself, and so this effort pays off in more ways than one.',\n",

These direct ad buys are often much more expensive than what you would pay through Google AdWords or other ad networks. Sometimes, these web sites will sell ads directly, and sell any unused page views (\"impressions\") through Google\\'s AdSense network. These left-over ad impressions are known as \"remnant ads,\" and they can offer an opportunity to test the waters on a website without spending a lot of money. Check if your website is one you can target as a placement in your AdWords account, and if so, you can probably get some ads on it at a very low cost.',\n",
              " \"Those remnant ads tend to be for lower-value placements on the site however, so you can't necessarily use their performance as a gauge for how well a better-placed banner ad at the top of their site would do.\",\n",
              " 'How can you decide if a paid ad placement on a specific website is worthwhile? Well, a decent assumption is that perhaps 1% of people who see your ad on a relevant website will click on it. You can use metrics from your website to estimate what percentage of visitors to your website end up buying something, and use that information to estimate the amount of sales this ad might generate. If it’s substantially more than the expense of a given number of ad impressions, then this could be money well spent.',\n",
              " 'Oftentimes, the math won\\'t support the ad buy. The person selling you this ad will probably talk a lot about \"brand awareness\" and other intangible benefits of the ad, but you will never have any way of measuring whether it\\'s effective. Just let them know what price does make sense for you– if they aren\\'t selling through their available ad impressions, they may give you a bargain or some sort of attractive bundle deal.',\n",

We\\'ll talk more about Google Analytics and measuring website performance later, but if you do use Google Analytics, it offers a \"URL Builder\" tool that can construct the required URL\\'s for you. You\\'ll want to review the performance of this ad at least once a month, as you\\'ll probably find that its performance deteriorates over time as people become accustomed to your ad. When that happens, you may want to try replacing the banner ad with a fresh one in order to catch more attention.',\n",

Some websites will offer \"advertorial\" features or “native ads” that integrate into the design of the site itself, and these are often more effective than traditional banner ads – but also more expensive.',\n",

There is a whole science to creating ads with just the right colors, contrast, and style to maximize their performance. It's money well spent. Arm your designer with some images and a very short amount of text you want included in the ad, and let them come up with ideas.

There are \"click farms\" in places like the Philippines that have armies of people creating fake Facebook accounts that generate fake likes and shares for people. These can affect you, because to escape detection, they \"like\" other things they are presented (such as your ad) so it\\'s not so obvious what they are doing. The more sophisticated click farms even make it look like their clicks are originating from US cities, making them difficult to filter out. As a basic line of defense, at least set up some geographical targeting in your account to only show your ads to people in parts of the world that are likely to respond to them. There are stories of small businesses spending lots of money on Facebook ads, only to find out later that most of their response came from a click farm in Iraq. No joke.

If the sales number you end up with exceeds the cost of the ad, it may be worth trying.

If you've followed my advice about building a business that has a global reach, local TV, radio, and news advertising probably isn't worthwhile– but for many businesses, it is. As with online advertising, the key is to find a way to target your message to the people most likely to respond to it. If there's a local TV show and you know most of its viewers are potential customers of yours, it's worth thinking about. Advertising on it won't be cheap, but it might be something you decide to save up for.\",\n",

Consider a nearby billboard, or an ad on a bus stop bench. Is there a popular Meetup group for them? Consider hosting that group at your own venue, joining it, or sponsoring it. Selling your stuff at a Meetup gathering is poor form, but it's totally OK to tell people what you do while introducing yourself. People who might be interested will talk to you afterward.\",\n",

You're looking at over $10,000 plus travel expenses for even the smallest booth in most cases, so you need to be pretty confident that your presence there will generate more than $10,000 in new profits. For a small business, that's a pretty tall order. And you can't just put up a booth in the corner and expect people to come dump money on your lap– you need to do a lot of work before the trade show to publicize your booth to attendees, and arrange meetings with potential customers at the show ahead of time. You'll need to invest a lot of time in following up with people afterwards, as well. Often it's more cost-effective to just attend the show as an individual, and carry around a bunch of business cards for the connections you make while you're there. I like to walk around with a tablet running a demo of my software, so I can show interested parties my technology without a booth at all (be careful not to run afoul of any policies of the trade show when doing something like that– your smartphone may have to do if attendees aren't permitted to bring larger items onto the show floor). You may get more value focusing your time on networking at the show, instead of manning a booth. Still, consider it carefully. In some industries (arcade games come to mind), a booth at a specific trade show is basically the only way in, so I can't provide one-size-fits-all advice on the topic.\",\n",

About 10% of the people I contacted ended up purchasing my product– which is an excellent return on some paper, a stamp, and a few minutes of my time!

Twitter is about building up your subscriber base, and staying active not only with your own announcements but in the discussions of others. Even if you have a product announcement that gets re-tweeted by some account with a huge amount of followers, you'll just see a surge of traffic that disappears within a few minutes. The goal here is to become a well-known name within the community of your potential customers– and that's better served by re-tweeting information that is useful to them, regardless of whether it comes from your company or not.

Google Analytics allows you to break down your conversion data by location and source, and to analyze the path users took before they completed your conversion actions. Trends that you see in your conversion data will affect your bottom line and your livelihood, so it is critical to monitor, understand, and act upon this data. If conversions for a specific product are dropping, you need to figure out how to boost its marketing, make the product more appealing, make its web page more likely to convert, and/or abandon it in favor of creating a better product.',\n",

The balance between free and paid traffic is good to understand, as it lets you know how important those paid advertisements really are to your business. Ideally you’d want your traffic to grow over time, but come increasingly from free sources like good SEO and PR practices. This view also makes it easy to determine the return on investment on your paid advertising, which may influence your decisions on whether to spend more or less on it. Digging into the “referral” channel can also be interesting; as it lets you know what other websites are driving traffic to yours.

Visitor data can also be polluted by malicious traffic, such as referrer spam13 or click fraud. Or maybe you have an ad on a display network that got picked up by some mobile app that tricks its customers into clicking on it, resulting in more junk traffic to your site. It's those goals, also referred to as conversions in Google Analytics, which you should be focusing on– not page views or visits.\",\n",

Many times I've been excited to see a surge in traffic to my website, only to find that it's all coming from a country that doesn’t even speak English and is likely part of some click fraud ring.

It could be indicative of a technical problem with your website, a change to search engine algorithms that affected you, an important referrer dropped their link to your site, or it could just mean that you haven't spent enough time on marketing lately. Checking your Google Analytics metrics every day is sure to shake you into action when things are not heading in the right direction.\",\n",

It's those long-term trends that are the hardest to turn around, so you need to be aware of them if they exist, understand what's driving them, and do something about them if your business is to survive. Perhaps your product is simply losing its relevance in the marketplace slowly over time, despite your best efforts to market it. Doubling down further on marketing is not the answer in that case– the answer is to start building a new product that addresses the new problems your customers need to solve.\",\n",

Keep an eye on your business bank account, and have a number in mind below which you start to get worried. It's easy to overspend on advertising, and it's easy for markets to change or for competitors to eat into your business– requiring you to build a new product before revenue from the old one completely dries up.

Most email platforms allow you to set up automatic rules to send a series of pre-written emails over time to new customers when they are added to your mailing list. For example, once a potential customer signs up for a trial of your product, you can automatically email that person a few days later to ask how it's going, and to offer some tips for getting the most out of the trial. Just prior to the end of the trial period, that customer can receive another automated email reminding them it's time to purchase it. Your customers are busy, and they need these reminders. A computer can send those reminders just as well as a human being can– once a human being has written the form-letter emails once. It's good to include contact information if they do want to talk to you, but most people just need a little nudge. That nudge can make a real difference in your sales.

Start with a very small, well-defined task, with a strict upper bound on the cost or number of hours you are willing to spend on it. Make sure this number is one you are comfortable potentially losing. If the contractor meets your expectations, you can start outsourcing larger tasks as your budget permits. If not, then you haven’t lost much. Take advantage of the flexible and temporary relationship of a contractor in order to try them out before committing to larger projects.',\n",

The important points are to be very clear on the deliverables, when they are due, when and how payment will be made, who owns the resulting intellectual property, and where the work will be performed. It must also be clear that the contractor is responsible for their own benefits and taxes and is using their own equipment. If you are providing equipment and/or a workplace for your contractors, the IRS may question if they are in fact employees instead – and that’s a headache you don’t need.

Is there some aspect of the manufacturing or creation of your current products that would make it easy to create new ones? I did this with the software development kits my company sells– realizing that the market of software developers was relatively small, I used my own software to develop add-ons for a popular flight simulator game.  With a few months of effort, I was able to leverage the years that went into developing that software to create a highly competitive product for flight simulation enthusiasts. Today, this derivative product brings in over $100,000 per year in revenue– and the up-front costs were just a few months of my development effort.',\n",

That weekend of effort ended up generating about $1000 per month for years. Not huge money, but it was definitely a good return on the investment of my time. One hour that weekend created $1,800 over the following three years. Not a bad hourly pay rate!\",\n",

If every year you launch a new product that generates $100,000 per year– you'll be making a million dollars per year, every year, after ten years. That's much easier said than done; not all of your products will be a smashing success and revenue from older products will likely decline over time. But if you have the discipline to always be launching new products, they can create ongoing revenue streams for you that just keep adding together year after year. \",\n",
              " \"It takes hard work and diligence, but forcing yourself to find time to launch new product ideas is what leads to long-term wealth. Increasing the sales of an existing product by 20% can take a lot of work. Launching a new product that sells more than 20% of your existing product may be a lot easier. Even if you only achieve 20% growth every year– that's a much better return than you'd get from the stock market, or from pay raises in a corporate job.\",\n",

I know exactly one, personally. All those new products take time to support, and there are only so many tasks you can outsource or automate. Your available time will ultimately place an upper bound on your earnings, not to mention the quality of your ideas and your ability to execute on every aspect of building them and promoting them. If you start hitting the wall of your own time, you need to decide whether to hire others to continue growing your business, or be content with maintaining the cash flow– and personal freedom– you have already achieved. That is what is known as a good problem to have.\",\n",

You don't need a million dollars per year to live as comfortably as you can reasonably imagine.
